A museum here presents the lemon's former role in the local economy. The city derived its name (and its nickname, The Circle City) from the curious layout of its streets, with a standard grid enclosed by the circular Grand Boulevard, 2.75 miles in circumference. In 1896, originally named South Riverside, the city was renamed Corona for Grand Boulevard, where three international automobile races were held in 1913, 1914 and 1916.  Corona can also claim as former residents, Lucille Ball and husband Desi Arnaz.

Corona is situated only 50 minutes southeast of Los Angeles in Riverside County. Coronaâ€™s location at the intersection of Interstate 15 and US 91 at the gateway to the Inland Empire make Corona a superb location to call home and allows for easy access to shopping, health care, parks and many other amenities.
